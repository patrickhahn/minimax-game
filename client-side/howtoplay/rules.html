		<li> The goal of the game is to earn as many points as possible</li>
		<li> You earn points for each tile you own </li>
		<ul> <li> The point value of each tile (1-99) is printed on the tile</li> 
		</ul>
		<li> Tiles owned by you are dark blue, those owned by the CPU are pink </li>
		<li> To own a tile, you click on it, which will change the tile to your color</li> 
		<li> If you click an unclaimed tile that is touching another tile you own vertically or horizontally (not diagonally)
		it converts all enemy-owned surrounding tiles to your color</li>
